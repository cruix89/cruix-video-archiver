## üè∑Ô∏è: IMAGE TAGS

- **`unstable`**: built on new üêô GitHub commits; updates `yt-dlp` to latest commit.
- **`latest`**: built on new `yt-dlp` releases; auto-updates during runtime.
- **`v<VERSION>`**: built on `yt-dlp` release; does not auto-update.

## üìÇ: CONFIGURATION

- **cache folder**  
  temporary directory where files are processed, the script automatically cleans the directory after the process. 

  
- **archive.txt**  
  records downloaded video IDs, delete to re-download all.


- **args.conf**  
  stores `yt-dlp` arguments, customizable for different needs.


- **ffmpeg_cache.txt**  
  this cache file stores the files already processed by ffmpeg, if you want to reprocess your library, delete this file.


- **ffmpeg_failed_files_cache.txt**  
  this cache stores library files that were corrupted and failed in the process. If this file appears in your /config, examine the source files.


- **links.txt**  
  location: `/config/links.txt`. channel list or playlist URLs to download.


  adding a new link by .txt editing:
  ```plaintext
  # CHANNEL
  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePOvb3aG9w
  
  # YTSEARCH
  ytsearch10:funny-pranks-compilation
  
  # YTSEARCH TO MY CUSTOM FOLDER
  ytsearch10:funny-pranks-compilation | --output '/downloads/pranks-videos-to-my-kids/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
  ```
  adding a new link by docker command:
  ```plaintext
  docker exec cruix-music-archiver bash -c 'echo "# CHANNEL" >> ./links.txt'
  docker exec cruix-music-archiver bash -c 'echo "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePOvb3aG9w" >> ./links.txt'
  docker exec cruix-music-archiver bash -c 'echo "# YTSEARCH" >> ./links.txt'
  docker exec cruix-music-archiver bash -c 'echo "ytsearch10:funny-pranks-compilation" >> ./links.txt'
  docker exec cruix-music-archiver bash -c 'echo "# YTSEARCH TO MY CUSTOM FOLDER" >> ./links.txt'
  docker exec cruix-music-archiver bash -c 'echo "ytsearch10:funny-pranks-compilation | --output '/downloads/pranks-videos-to-my-kids/%(title)s.%(ext)s'" >> ./links.txt'
  ```

- **post-execution.sh**  
  these are the script that run before and after the downloads to process and manage the video files normalization.

## ‚ú® : TIPS AND TRICKS

- **`ytsearch:` function**  

configuring the function ytsearch to save in the default download folder, this function is added in the links.txt also, 
Exemple:
  ```plaintext
  ytsearch10:funny-pranks-compilation
  ```
in this case the function will save the first 10 results. Change the number to how many files you want to download 
for each search. You can place as many lines as you want, respecting one line for each search. 
Exemple:
```plaintext
  ytsearch10:funny-pranks-compilation
  ytsearch50:best-goals
  ytsearch500:karaoke
  ```
setting the custom output folder to ytsearch save your files, 
Exemple:
  ```plaintext
  ytsearch10:funny-pranks-compilation | --output '/downloads/pranks-videos-to-my-kids/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
  ytsearch50:best-goals | --output '/downloads/goals-videos-to-my-dad/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
  ytsearch500:karaoke | --output '/downloads/karaoke-songs-for-mommy/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
  ```

- **custom output folders for any link**

   it's possible to configure a custom output folder for any link, 
Exemple:
```plaintext
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VoT-KrseHA&pp=ygUHS0F | --output '/downloads/special-videos/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
  https://www.youtube.com/@anychannel | --output '/downloads/my-favorite-channels/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
  ```

## ‚ùå:  EXCEPTIONS

- **unsupported arguments**
 ```plaintext
  --config-location, hardcoded to /config/args.conf.
  --batch-file, hardcoded to /config/links.txt.
  ```
